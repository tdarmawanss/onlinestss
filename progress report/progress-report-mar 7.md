Its becoming clear that the synchronisation between the online store DB and the company DB will require substantial work in ensuring that the data relations are compatible between existing Customer, Orders, Product tables with the WooCommerce tables. WooCommerce uses MySQL, while the company uses MSSQLServer. There will need to be a middleware installed to connect these two systems, which is more work. The bottleneck is that the only person who is familiar with the data structure intimately is ES - who has a lot on his plate already from other projects.

A redesign of the currently deployed systems to change the local cabang databases with a national cloud one may be advisable, to reduce complexity in the online shopping processes. This will require changing the existing systems, which is outside the scope of the project as of now. *It is my recommendation that a meeting be held to discuss the overall database synchronisation plan.*
